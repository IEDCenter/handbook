# Scale
Scaling up is when you have a well-oiled machine in your startup and you want to produce more and more of it. A repeatable business model is a necessity for the Scale stage, but it is not sufficient. Depending on the kind of startup you have, there are different ways to scale up, but they usually have a lot of things in common.

## Scaling Fast
While scaling, these are important considerations to keep in mind:

* You should have a clear idea of how much money and other resources you need to scale. This is the outcome of a good Efficiency stage, and if you do not have this, it's wise to go back to figure this out.
* Your entire system should be stable and ready for scaling up. 
* You should have a clear idea about which roles in your company need professional support. As an example, there is often a real need for a professionally trained finance officer to make sure your funding rounds go ahead great.
* You should be able to break down larger processes in your system to smaller repeatable processes. This is important to make sure that you can find a responsible person to handle these smaller processes.

## Typical Activities
These are the typical activities in the Scale stage:

* Raising a Series A round of Investment
* Massive customer acquisition
* Back-end scalability improvements
* First executive hires
* Process implementation
* Establishment of departments

## Average Duration
The average duration of the Scale stage is 1-2 years.

## Team Objective
The Team Objective at this Stage is to raise Series A funding to scale up and hire resources.

## Key Result
The Key Result is to have the company generate enough cash for growth or raising investment with investors money in the company’s bank account.

Let's talk a look now at individual roles and how that leads to the above Key Result:

## Product Role
At the scaling stage, you are on the verge of becoming a larger company. The primary person handling the Product Role at such a company would soon have to delegate his responsibility to subordinates. This requires clear articulation of what each product is, and relevant metrics for the startup as a whole, and for individual products in particular.

Resources:

* This Quora question talks about how [Product Management is at larger companies](http://www.quora.com/How-is-being-a-Product-Manager-at-a-larger-company-Google-Facebook-different-from-being-a-Product-Manager-at-a-start-up). There are both good and bad examples, and it's a good read to figure out how you want to structure the product role at your own startup.
* This comic of [What the Customer Really Wanted](https://robonthemoon.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/what-the-customer-really-wanted-–-happy-thanksgiving/) is an illustration of how things can go wrong during product development. While scaling up, managing customer expectations throughout your organization is important.


## Engineering Role
As the primary lead Engineer in your startup, you would soon have to delegate responsibility to Engineering Managers. This is an exciting time, but it's also a challenging one. Make sure that Engineering practices in your startup are codified, and learn about the art of managing people. Hint: it's much more difficult than writing code.

Resources:

* Learn about the [differences between a CTO and VP, Engineering](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-of-engineering/). While these are both titles, their functions in the organization can be quite different too. Here's [another article talking about the same distinction](http://avc.com/2011/10/vp-engineering-vs-cto/).
* The [Phoenix Project](http://www.amazon.in/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) is a great book about how great Engineering management practices can influence organizations. It's told in the form of an easily understood story with instructive lessons in between.


## Marketing & Sales Role

A startup is all about growth. Once a startup is growing very fast, almost everything else falls in place.

The key task at this stage would be:

1. Creating your complete Investor Pitch Deck to talk to potential investors by filling in all the data that you have gathered from the business.
2. Creating a powerful narrative by weaving together the story and your financial/sales numbers which would explain to investor how your company is growing super fast and will be highly profitable.

Resources:

* [Startup=Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) is one of the best essays on how growth defines a startup.
* [Story Telling and Growth Numbers](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.in/2014/06/numbers-and-narrative-modeling-story.html) describes how to now link the story you have created with the actual numbers from your effiiency stage and project to the total market size.

## Governance Role

If your startup is growing fast, this stage is when many options such as raising your Series-A funding, Joining an Accelerator or even getting acquired as a business start to be real possibilities. 

You will prepare for a Series A round of Investment at this stage. You will hire your first professional executives and put them in charge of various departments that you have established over time.

The Organisation Structure will now be an important discussion as there could (not always necessary though) be more people who will join the company in rapid progress as you scale.

You will start getting ready for Board Meeting and Board Packages (presentations on how your company is doing along with financial statements to investors and/or board members) as well from this stage to transform from an amateur startup team to a professional startup team.

Resources:
* [The Eighteen Mistakes that kill startups](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html) is a great Paul Graham essay on startup failure, with a lot of them particularly relevant to the Scaling stage.
* [The Difference between Winning and Succeeding](http://www.ted.com/talks/john_wooden_on_the_difference_between_winning_and_success) and [How to  learn from mistakes](http://www.ted.com/talks/diana_laufenberg_3_ways_to_teach) are great TED talks for growing leaders at this stage.
* [How to  successfully  apply to YCombinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply/) is a must read if you are planning to apply to YC or any other accelerator.

## Design Role
Being the design lead of a company about to achieve scale is exciting. You have more resources to perfect your design, you have a coherent design language to enable your team and lots of feedback to improve your product. It's also easy to get lost in the morass of contradictory feedback and lose sight of simple and effective design principles. Your job is to stay grounded and lead design thinking at the next stage of the startup.

Resources:

* [Design Thinking](https://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking) is about how to apply principles behind design to your whole company. Now that you have ample resources, why not take the time to infect your entire company with design thinking?
* This is an example from the old Google, but [it's a cautionary tale of how too much testing can negatively influence design](http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html).

## Common Failures

* Adding “nice to have” features
* Hiring managers (VPs, product managers, etc.) instead of doers.
* Not adapting business model to a changing market.
* Failing to focus on the business model and finding out that you can’t get costs lower than revenue at scale.
