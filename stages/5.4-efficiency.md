# Efficiency

Efficiency happens when you can replicate your product-market fit across a much larger set of customers. Before you expand your startup after the Customer Validation stage, it's wise to think about whether your product idea can actually work at scale: this is what the Efficiency stage is about. A lot of ideas are easy to implement when the user base is low, but are much harder when the number of customers or the number of engagements go up. 

As an example, if you have an education product that teaches folks how to program, it might be dependent on having good teachers. When you have a small number of students, your existing teacher set might suffice. But when you try to scale up, it might be difficult (or even impossible) to find qualified teachers for all your students. You might then decide to more efficiently run your classrooms by increasing the student to teacher ratio by using virtual classrooms or perhaps advocate self-learning altogether. These kinds of problems must be solved *before* you scale: if they aren't, then having a large marketing budget will only lead to more users unable to get a good experience with your product.

## Tests for Efficiency

When you want an efficient startup, you must have these in mind:

* A sound financial model that describes money in and money out. It's important that any marketing budgets or overheads you have are accounted properly, and any direct costs are in proportion to your revenue. 
* A model to increase your MAUs in proportion with your costs. 
* Increasing virality indicators throughout your product.
* A sound and optimized user-experience process that delivers increasing conversion rates.

## Typical Activities

* Value proposition refined
* UX optimized, 
* Conversion funnel optimized
* Viral growth achieved
* Repeatable sales process and/or scalable customer acquisition channels found.

## Average Duration
The average duration for the Efficiency stage is 8-12 months.

## Objective
The Team Objective at this Stage is to figure out an efficient business model.

## Key Result
The Key Result is having many customers using or buying your product leading to active growth.

Let's talk a look now at individual roles and how that leads to the above Key Result:

## Product Role
The Product role has the responsibility to identify features in the product that would scale to a large number of users.

* Focusing on Design Sprints again, here's another video of [a sprint with Gimlet Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqGLrMjBLZ4).
* How to get into [Product Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqJo_UkMMxM) is a great overview towards Product Management.
* [Product Development = Tradeoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBtzBAS9Bo). Nothing more needs to be said.

## Engineering Role
At the Efficiency stage, the Engineering role is focused on improving the efficiency of systems, both wetware (people) & software, and increasing throughput.

Resources:

* [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com) is a great site that has many scenarios for scaling different use cases. Remember NIH? There's a good chance that your scalability problem has already been solved here.
* A good understanding of [Technical Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) is essential at this stage. While following sound engineering management practices like Agile reduce debt, having focused debt-clearing activities can also help.
* Programmer Happiness is crucial, and one of the most important factors to cater to is health. The [Healthy Programmer book](http://healthyprog.com) talks about various tips and techniques to manage health. Promoting startup-wide initiatives to improve happiness can also be great.
* Another measure that can improve programmer happiness is organizing [BoF groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29) inside the company.

## Marketing & Sales Role

The essence of any sustainable company is that you have customers who are either paying directly or indirectly (eg:through advertising) for your product and the costs of acquiring these customers is lower than the cost of running the business.

You have three key tasks at this stage:

1. Develop a sales and marketing strategy for customer acquisition. 
2. Find the total life time value of customers and see if you have a repeatable sales cycle where total life time value is more than cost of customer acquisition.
3. Ensure that you raise an invoice to your customer(s) and collect payments on time. Collection is a very important task as it directly increases the cash in your bank account which lets you pay your salaries and bills.

* [How to create a marketing plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=45&v=zlPCO6xrp1A) is a short two minute video to get your started.
* [How to calcuate customer life-time value](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-calculate-lifetime-value/) is an Infographic that gives your the basic overview.


## Governance Role

Financial Reports and Key Metrics are now being tracked continously as you start to hit efficiency. You will most probably need to have a round of funding at this stage as there would be many experiments you have to do before you find an efficient way of aqquiring customers.

As the sales engine starts working overtime, you will also start to have increased costs and possibly start hiring more people. Its a good time to learn about how to interview and select the right people and also how to leave them with dignity if the hire is not doing well.

WIP.

## Design Role

At the efficiency stage, the Design role is about improving UX so that conversion funnels are optimized. More importantly, the Design role can also set up repeatable processes via a design language that Engineers can then use to implement common scenarios.

Resources:

* [Uber Brand Guide](http://brand.uber.com) is a good example of design language as it applies to a brand. It lays out in very simple terms how Uber designs its pages. Producing such a document for your startup might be worthwhile!
* [Introducing a Design Language at UCL](http://www.slideshare.net/DanJackson2/dj-aarhus2013) is a great presentation about how a non-design focused institution implemented a design language.
* [How to Measure a User's Experience](http://www.slideshare.net/warwickkay/how-to-measure-a-users-experience) provides a quick overview of various methods to measure (and improve) UX.
* [Lean UX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SNSA6pmzjM) is a great video about measuring UX in a lean environment.

## Common Failures

* Raising too little money. You need money to drive experiments and user growth.
* Raising too much money. This might seem like a contradiction, but too much money makes founders indisciplined. Remember: money is not the solution to your problems, it's just a means to arrive at it.
* Having more than 1 level of hierarchy.
* Overcompensating for a missing product/market fit with marketing and press. Marketing and Press does not equate to business success, when used effectively they are just a tool to rope in customers.

## Proceeding to Scale

When you have identified and solved efficiency bottlenecks in your startup, you can proceed to [Scale](5.5-scale.md).
